# Phone number to words

Phones has a map between numbers and letters. 2 -> A,B,C; 3 -> D,E,F: and so on. 

Given a phone number, return all possible words that represent that number.

Example:

3569377 -> FLOWERS (and many others)

Since 1 and 0 doesn't have a letter, we will start mapping it to themselves.

6912265 -> My1Bank
